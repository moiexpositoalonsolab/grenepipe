channels:
  # This env was a long term problem, as it failed to get resolved by conda (working perfectly fine
  # with mamba though). We now tried to use conda-forge as the first channel, and have updated a few
  # versions of the packages below. It seems to be working... for now.
  # conda-forge channel first, as required by issue #25
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
  # In issue #11 it was mentioned that removing some channels solves the problem.
  # But of course it did not... trying to add this one again, in the hope that this
  # helps with this nightmare of an environemnt.
